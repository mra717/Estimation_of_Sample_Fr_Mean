# Estimation of the Sample Fréchet Mean: A Convolutional Neural Network Approach

Many real world complex systems are well represented as
graphs, where agents represent nodes and the edges connecting them
represent some sort of underlying relationship between the respective
agents. To characterize the “average” of a set of graphs, one can compute
the sample Fréchet mean.  In practice the Fr ́echet mean is calculated
from a sample of graphs that display specific topological features of in-
terest. To capture such features and take full advantage of the sample,
one to needs to insure that the sample Fr ́echet mean inherits the desired
topological structures present in the sample. This work aims to address
this rising demand for novel tools in statistical and machine learning for
“graph-valued random variables” by attempting to solve the inheritance
issue and answer the following question: how does one estimate the mean
of a set of graphs in a manner that guarantees that the mean inherits
the structural properties of the graphs in the set?  

In this repositopry you will find the releveant scripts used to for data generation, model building, and testing. 
This will be updated with the pretrained models, the actual data used for training and testing , and the paper as we work towards publication.
